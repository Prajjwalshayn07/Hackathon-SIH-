# 🔐 HOW TO ACCESS ADMIN PANEL

## 📍 Admin Panel URLs:

### Live Website (Vercel):
```
https://civic-issue-reporter-nqhd775fr-prajjwals-projects-3400e066.vercel.app/gov-admin-2024
```

### Local Development:
```
http://localhost:3001/gov-admin-2024
```

## 🔑 Login Credentials:

**Username:** `admin`  
**Password:** `admin123`

## 📝 Step-by-Step Access:

### For Live Website:

1. **Go to the secret admin URL:**
   ```
   https://civic-issue-reporter-nqhd775fr-prajjwals-projects-3400e066.vercel.app/gov-admin-2024
   ```

2. **You'll be redirected to login page**

3. **Enter credentials:**

## 🎯 Admin Features:

Once logged in, you can:
- View all reported issues
- Update issue status (Pending → In Progress → Resolved)
- Assign departments
- Add comments
- View analytics and charts
- Filter issues by category/status
- Delete test issues

## ⚠️ Important Notes:

1. **The URL `/gov-admin-2024` is intentionally hidden** - it's not linked anywhere on the public site
2. **Session expires after 30 minutes** - you'll need to login again
3. **Change the password** in production (edit `login.html` line 260-263)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting:

### If login doesn't work:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Try incognito/private mode
3. Make sure JavaScript is enabled

### If redirected back to login:
- Session expired (30 min timeout)
